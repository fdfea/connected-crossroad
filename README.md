# Connected Crossroad

*Connected Crossroad* is an android application that utilizes Google's nearby connections API to create a mobile ad-hoc network between android devices in an effort to help create a connected transportation system. Specifically, it allows pedestrians to easily notify drivers with their intentions to cross roads.

This application is in active development at the University of Virginia as part of the "Exploring Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) to Enable Connected
Transportation Services" research being conducted in [Dr. Haiying Shen's Pervasive Communications Laboratory](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~hs6ms/research.htm).

More details to come soon.

## Building application

I recommend using Android Studio. If you use Android Studio, it will be able to detect all of the software you are missing (such as the needed Android SDK) and prompt you to install everything you need to build this project. To start this process, open the project in Android Studio and attempt to build/run it. Errors will pop up in the Android Studio build log with clickable links to download needed softare.

Emulators won't work with the Nearby Connections API, so testing should be done with physical Android devices. You can use an emulator to test UI changes though.
